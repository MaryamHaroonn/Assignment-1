                And what has that gotten us? It’s made us the #1 Dermatologist-recommended professional sunscreen brand, for starters. In fact, more Dermatologists use EltaMD personally than any other professional sun care brand.
                
                And it’s led to a line of products that feel so good on skin, you’ll forget they’re actually doing work—which of course, they are. Backed by our medical heritage, we’ve spent the last 30 years working with some of the best Dermatologists in the country to develop safe and effective products for every skin type’s every need. Products proven to protect, heal, and renew.

In 1988, that Swiss secret made its way to the US by way of our founder who saw its full healing potential and developed a line of professional wound care products called Elta. That line soon became the trusted choice in healing at hospitals, burn centers and rehabilitation clinics around the world. In 2007, we brought our medical heritage and science-backed formulas to everyday products and became the EltaMD we are today </font></td>
